REGION_SHORT     = "Catalonia"
AUTHOR_NAME      = "Franck"

## WHAT THIS PROMPT ADDS

1. Verify + fix SEO meta tags on all existing hub pages
2. 5 full-length article .md files (2,500–4,000 words each)
3. FAQ sections at bottom of every article (7+ questions each)
4. Correct schema on all pages
5. Internal linking between articles and hub pages

Do NOT rebuild any existing components or layouts.
Run `astro check` after each major step.

---

## STEP 1 — VERIFY SEO META ON ALL HUB PAGES

Check each hub page has ALL of the following:
- Unique title following format: "[Title] | [SITE_NAME]"
- Meta description 120–155 chars
- Canonical URL (absolute)
- og:image pointing to absolute URL [SITE_URL]/images/og-default.jpg
- CollectionPage JSON-LD (NOT Article type)
- FAQPage JSON-LD with 5+ questions
- "Last updated: [Month Year]" visible on page

If any are missing, add them. Report what was fixed.

---

## STEP 2 — ARTICLE CONTENT COLLECTION

Verify `src/content/articles/` directory exists with schema in config.ts.
If not, create per PROMPT-1 spec.

---

## STEP 3 — FIVE ARTICLES

Create these 5 article .md files. Each must be 2,500–4,000 words.
Each must include:
- Frontmatter: title, description, publishDate, category, targetKeyword, readingTime
- StatBar data (4 stats relevant to the topic)
- ComparisonTable (at least one per article)
- TipBox callouts (3–5 per article)
- FAQ section at the end (7 questions minimum)
- Internal links to relevant hub pages and other articles
- "Last updated" date in frontmatter

### Article structure template (follow this for all 5):
```
1. Intro (2–3 paragraphs) — hook, thesis, why this matters
2. StatBar component
3. Main content sections (H2 headings, 300–600 words each)
4. ComparisonTable
5. Budget section (costs, price ranges)
6. Practical tips section (10 specific tips)
7. FAQ section (FAQAccordion, 7+ questions)
8. Related articles (auto-generated by ArticleLayout)
```

---

## STEP 4 — FAQ CONTENT GUIDELINES

Every FAQ section must:
- Use real questions from traveler forums (Tripadvisor, Reddit, travel blogs)
- Have 7+ questions per article
- Provide complete, useful answers (not one-liners)
- Use FAQAccordion component
- Trigger automatic FAQPage JSON-LD injection

Question types that work best:
- "Is X worth it?" — give a direct yes/no then explain
- "How long do you need?" — specific time recommendations
- "Do I need to speak [language]?" — practical answer
- "What's the best time to visit?" — specific months with reasons
- "How much does it cost?" — actual price ranges
- "Is it safe?" — direct, not alarmist

---

## STEP 5 — SCHEMA VERIFICATION

After all articles are created, verify:

**Articles:**
- [ ] "@type": "TravelArticle" (not generic Article)
- [ ] author: Person with name and /about/ URL
- [ ] image: ImageObject with og-[slug].jpg URL
- [ ] datePublished and dateModified present
- [ ] inLanguage: "en"
- [ ] BreadcrumbList as second JSON-LD block

**Hub pages:**
- [ ] "@type": "CollectionPage" on all hub pages
- [ ] FAQPage JSON-LD on all hub pages

**Test:** Run each article through search.google.com/test/rich-results
Expected: Breadcrumbs ✅ + FAQ ✅ on every article

---

## STEP 6 — INTERNAL LINKING

For each article, ensure:
- 2–3 links TO relevant hub pages (anchor text matches hub page topic)
- 1–2 links TO other articles where relevant
- Hub pages link TO relevant articles (not just listing them in CardGrid)
- /tips/ page links to at least 4 articles (not just 1)
